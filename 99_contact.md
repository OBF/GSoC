Before applying, please read our [documentation on information that students
should know and guidelines we expect you to follow](../guide/). We also require that you
include certain information, listed below, under "[When you apply.](../guide/#when-you-apply)"

### Staff and Org Admins

#### Organisation administrator
Kai Blin [kblin@biosustain.dtu.dk](mailto:kblin@biosustain.dtu.dk) (IRC: kblin | channels: #obf-soc, #gsoc)

#### Backup administrator
NN (Interested in helping out? Email Kai.)

### Google Plus
[OBF Summer of Code](https://plus.google.com/communities/103096212020630764091) on G+

### Email
For prospective students, the first point of contact should be the mailing list
of the OBF project you are interested in working with:

#### GeneNetwork / Biodalliance
* [Mailing list GeneNetwork](http://listserv.uthsc.edu/mailman/listinfo/genenetwork-dev)
* [Mailing list Biodalliance](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodalliance-dev)


#### antiSMASH
* [gsoc@secondarymetabolites.org](mailto:gsoc@secondarymetabolites.org)

Also, it would be a good idea to CC the organization administrator [Kai
Blin](mailto:kblin@biosustain.dtu.dk), so he can make sure that you are properly
taken care of!

If you are not quite sure which project you would like to contribute to, you
can email to the organization administrator for help. However, do not worry
overly much about picking the right OBF project at the outset. If you are
unsure, simply make your best guess, and other members of the email list will
help you to find the best organization to suit your idea.

#### OpenMS
* [Mailing list OpenMS](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/open-ms-general)

### IRC - Internet Relay Chat

OBF IRC channels are maintained on [freenode](http://freenode.net/), connect your IRC client to `chat.freenode.net`.

Main OBF GSoC Channel
: `#obf-soc`

GeneNetwork
: `#genenetwork` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

Some mentors and developers can regularly be found on IRC, see the list of OBF
projects below for information on which projects have a channel and the name of
the channel. And/or join #obf-soc on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/). (If you
do not have an IRC client installed, you might find the [comparison on
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IRC_clients), the [Google
directory](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Chat/IRC/),
or the [IRC Reviews](http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/) helpful. For Macs,
[X-Chat Aqua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Chat) works pretty well.  If you
have never used IRC, try the [IRC
Primer](http://irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html) at [IRC
Help](http://irchelp.org/), which also has links to lots of other material.)
