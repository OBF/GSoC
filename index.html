  <h1 class="page-heading">Google Summer of Code</h1>

  <p>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a student internship program for
     open-source projects. The program offers eligible student developers stipends
     to write code for open source projects over a period of 3 summer months ("flip
     bits, not burgers"). See the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Google Summer of Code Main Site</a> for general
     information about the Google Summer of Code program, how to apply, frequently
     asked general questions, and more.

  <h2>GSoC 2017</h2>

  <p>
    The Google Summer of Code 2018 is ON! OBF is once again applying as a GSoC
    mentoring organization this year. Interested mentors and students should
    subscribe to the OBF/GSoC mailing list. Please announce yourself, so we know
    who you are! The details of each of our project ideas are listed below,
    including potential mentors.
  </p>

      <li>
          There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-discuss">Google group for posting GSoC questions</a>
          (and receiving answers; note that you will need to sign up for the group) that
          relate to the program itself (and are not specific to our organization).

      <li>
          Students receive a stipend from Google if accepted. See the <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq">GSoC FAQ</a> for
          full documentation.
      </li>
      <li>
          Development is done entirely remotely and on-line; there is no requirement or
          expectation for either students or mentors to travel.

    </ul>


  <h3>Why apply?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the most important features of the program is that students are paired
    with mentors, who are typically experienced developers from the project to
    which the student is contributing. The mentor guides the student to work
    productively within the community, and helps the student avoid obstacles and
    pitfalls. The program is global - students and mentors may be located anywhere
    where they have an internet connection (except for countries affected by US
    trade restrictions), and no travel is required. Thus, aside from the stipend
    and mentorship aspects, the student's experience in the internship closely
    mirrors normal work on distributed development projects. Effective work habits
    for distributed development are typically not taught as part of computer
    science curricula, yet are highly desired in the increasingly global and
    distributed software, IT, and biotechnology industries.
  </p>

  <p>
     From the viewpoint of each open-source project, the program not only offers to
     pay students for contributing, but more importantly, offers an opportunity to
     recruit new developers who will hopefully go on to become regular, sustaining
     contributors.

  <h2>Project ideas</h2>
    <p>Our GSoC ideas from each project are collected here:
       <a href="ideas/">OBF Project Ideas for GSoC 2018</a></p>

  <h2>Student Progress Reports</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to writing code, accepted students send weekly updates to the OBF
      community on their project's progress. These updates allow us to keep aware of
      how GSoC students are doing, give students a forum to ask any questions, and
      promote overall community bonding.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the beginning of the summer, we ask that you set up a blog for the GSoC
      project (or a category/tag on your existing blog) which you will use to
      summarize your progress every week, as well as longer posts about your work if
      you'd like. (See these examples from 2013.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, at the start of each week:

      Post an update on your blog: What did you do last week? What do you plan to
      do this week? Do you have any unanswered questions, any unsolved problems from
      the last week, interesting observations or anything else you'd like to mention?

      Email the URL and text of the post (or a short summary) to the host project's
      mailing list (your mentors will confirm which one to use) and the main OBF GSoC
      mailing list (gsoc@lists.open-bio.org).
    </p>

    <p>
      You will be writing under your own name, but with a clear association with your
      mentors, the OBF and its projects, so please take this seriously and be
      professional. Remember that your blog will be one of the first things found by
      anyone interested in the project you're working on, and can be a valuable
      resource to them â€” as well as a significant part of your online presence.
